# Tably

## Overview

Tably is a multi-agent AI system that revolutionizes restaurant ordering by automating and enhancing voice-based experiences across multiple languages, channels, and dietary needs. It addresses critical bottlenecks in high-volume restaurant operations, particularly in dine-in and quick-service restaurants (QSR), where human staff are often impacted by noise, fatigue, and time constraints.

The system enables customers to place orders naturally through voice, chat, or UI while providing restaurants with intelligent menu management, real-time stock tracking, and personalized recommendations to maximize order value and customer satisfaction.

## Multi-Agent Architecture

Tably employs a sophisticated multi-agent system where specialized AI agents collaborate to deliver a seamless ordering experience:

### 1. Voice Recognition Agent
- Processes natural language inputs in multiple languages (English, Spanish, and more)
- Handles various accents and speech patterns with high accuracy
- Adapts to noisy environments common in restaurants
- Provides real-time transcription and intent understanding

### 2. Menu Intelligence Agent
- Maintains comprehensive menu knowledge including items, combos, modifiers, and prices
- Tracks allergen information and nutritional data
- Manages real-time stock availability and automatically removes out-of-stock items
- Handles complex menu hierarchies and seasonal variations

### 3. Recommendation Agent
- Personalizes upsell and cross-sell suggestions based on:
  - Order history and customer preferences
  - Time of day and seasonal trends
  - Current promotions and combo deals
- Respects dietary constraints and allergen restrictions
- Optimizes recommendations for both customer satisfaction and order value

### 4. POS Integration Agent
- Seamlessly integrates with existing restaurant POS systems
- Synchronizes orders across all channels (drive-thru, phone, kiosk, mobile app)
- Updates inventory in real-time
- Manages payment processing and order routing to kitchen systems
